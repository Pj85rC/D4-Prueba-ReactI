# D4-Prueba-ReactI

D4-Render-dynamic-component is the final project of REACT module. 

## Description

The test consists of building an application that consumes an API of your choice. Later we will introduce each of the requirements in an explanatory video.

## Requirements

Create a component called MyApi.jsx and import it into App.jsx.

Inside MyApi.jsx, create the code to consume the API and display the results.

Create an input that filters by any of the API results. By
example name, price or any other type of criteria consistent with the result of
the API.

Sort the results by some criteria that you deem convenient, it can be
alphabetically, from smallest to largest, etc. Investigate the sort and reverse method of the
arrays.
